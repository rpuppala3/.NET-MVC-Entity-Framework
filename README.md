C# Projects
I have done 2 C# Projects:
This is project 1 for Car insurance.
- This porject is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance webiste. It takes user's input on policy information and caluclates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been used.
